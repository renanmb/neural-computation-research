Step 
Start by defining Computing as Modelling, essential step to prove that the architecture is capable of Computing.

The conclusion is that modeling is an essential element of physical computation, at least in current computational approaches in cognitive neuroscience.

It is crucial to distinguish between the notions of computational model and simulation on the one hand and computing-as-modeling on the other

The computational model and simulation refer to the use of computers to model and simulate the behavior and processes of physical, biological, social, and other systems. They do not, however assume that modeling is an essential feature of computing; the claim is that computers can be, and are, used for modeling and simulating other phenomena.

In contrast, the notion of computing-as-modeling is indifferent as to the actual use of computers for the purposes of modeling or simulating other phenomena; rather, the claim is that modeling is an essential element of the characterization of computing.


Step 

Introduce the neuroscience inspiration

Step 

Talk about the challenges in past models, lack of homomorphism



The text should start by introducing the concepts of Computing as Modelling
As well it should borrow a lot of the proves from The paper Emergence of Universal Computations Through Neural Manifold Dynamics
The paper makes the connection between Wilson-Cowan and Hopfield network to demonstrate that even a simplified low-rank representation is valid to capture the same dynamics of NNs
once we go through the proof of equivalence and that this is indeed an Universal Turing Machine
Expand to show that Hopfield NNs are part of a transformer and the ability of self-attention can be used with the Dynamics Flow
This shows that any Computation can emerge from adjusting very simple parameters and the transformer will predict the next position
It creates a flow capable of phase transitions thus moving across all the manifolds
